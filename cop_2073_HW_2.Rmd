# Problem 1 (20 points)

During class you completed an activity in which you practiced `git` commands and operations (such as forking a repository, cloning it using `git clone`, and uploading changes using `git push`).

In this exercise you will used **markdown** tools discussed in class.

## Part A

You must **create a table** that shows the courses you are currently enrolled in, using the following for the headers of the table:

-   Prefix: in bold letters (such as **COP**)
-   Number: in bold letters (such as **2073**)
-   Name: in italics (such as *Introduction to Data Science*)
-   Credits (such as 3)

| PREFIX  |  NUMBER  |                      NAME                       | CREDITS |
|:-------:|:--------:|:-----------------------------------------------:|:-------:|
| **COP** | **2073** |         *INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE*          |    3    |
| **BUL** | **2241** |                  *DATABASE 1*                   |    3    |
| **FIN** | **2001** |       *INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS FINANCE*        |    3    |
| **ENT** | **2112** |     *ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS*      |    3    |
| **BUL** | **2241** | *LAW, PUBLIC POLICY, NEGOTIATION, AND BUSINESS* |    3    |

## Part B

Take a screenshot of the GitHub repo you used in HW 01, add the screenshot file to the repo, and include it in this document (review how to insert a picture using markdown).

# Problem 2 (30 points)

For this problem, you are asked to create a list of **4 concepts** you have learned about so far this semester. Include the name of the course as a sub-heading (that is, using `##`), and the concepts as an unordered list. Include a link to information about *at least one* of the concepts you listed (for example a link to the Wikipedia page about that concept/topics).

*Edit this `.Rmd` file to include the solutions here.*

## BUL

-   Protecting Intellectual property

## DB

-   DBMS and structure(separate is better)

## ENT

-   Implement your ideas.

## ENT

-   Funding isn't as important as we think

# Problem 3 (25 points)

In this problem you will practice some basic R operations. Include solutions to each items by inserting a new R chunk of code (make sure you run the chunk so that the output is displayed)

(a) Create a variable called `my_name` that contains *your preferred name*.

```{r}
my_name < - "Angela Vue"
print(my_name)
```

(b) Create a variable called `name_length` that holds how many letters are in `my_name`.

```{r}
name_length < - nchar(my_name)
print(name_length)
```

(c) Show which value is bigger: $e^\pi$ or $\pi^e$. (Use the correct expressions for Euler's constant $e$ and the irrational number $\pi$ in R)

```{r}

if (exp(pi) < pi^exp(1)){
  print("e^/pi is less than pi^e")
}else{
  print("pi^e is more than e^pi")
}
  
```

(d) Use the colon operator `:` to create a vector `v` of numbers from 31 to 86. Find the length of this vector using the `length()` function.

```{r}
print(length(c(31:86)))
```

(e) Use the `seq()` function to produce a range of number from -5 to 10 in 0.5 increments.

```{r}
print(seq(-5,10,0.5))

```

# Problem 4 (25 points)

(a) (10 points) Define a function `imperial_to_metric` that takes in **two arguments**: a number of feet and a number of inches. The function should return the equivalent length in meters

> To convert a length `L` from feet (`ft`) and inches (`inches`) to meters (`m`), one can use the relation: `L(m) = L(ft) × 0.3048 + L(inches) × 0.0254`

```{r}
imperial_to_metric <- function(ft,inches){
  m = ft * 0.3048 + inches * 0.0254
  return(m)
}

```

(b) (5 points) Create a variable `height_in_meters` by passing your height in imperial to the `imperial_to_metric` function.

```{r}
height_in_meters <- imperial_to_metric(7,5)
print(height_in_meters)
```

(c) (5 points) Evaluate `round(3.1415)`, `factorial(12)`, `mean(1:17)`.

```{r}
round(3.1415)
factorial(12)
mean(1:17)
```

(d) (5 points) Create an object named `die` that contains the numbers one through six. Simulate a roll of the die with `R`'s `sample()` function.

```{r}
die <- c(1:6)
print(sample(die))
```
